# Old-MC-PlayerCommands

The second mod for my Old-MC series. This is a jarmod that allows you to use commands for Minecraft Alpha and Infdev. 

Works for Minecraft inf-20100630-2, a1.0.9, a1.1.2_01, and a1.2.6. 

<code style="color : gray">will expand to versions ranging from inf-227 to a1.2.6, after addressing various bugs and recommendations</code>

# Features

This mod is based off of Mojang's official implementation of commands and SPC by Simo_415. 

Commands: clear, fly, give, godmode, goto, heal, health, help, home, info, instamine, kill, killmob, listwaypoints, noclip, pos, rem, search, seed, set, setspawn, speed, spawn, teleport, time

You can activate the interface by pressing <code style="color : gray">T</code> and typing <code style="color : gray">/</code> followed by a command name</code>. Using <code style="color : gray">/help</code> will help you to get started. From there, <code style="color : gray">/help "COMMANDNAME"</code> will give you a command's description, syntax, and an example. 

For the most part, the mod itself should be able to help you without needing check back at this github repo for information.

That being said, there is still some specific info which I find relevant. I've made a secondary README to address these aspects of the mod, that would otherwise make this section very long.

# Downloads

As stated previously, this mod (currently) supports 4 versions to account for user recommendations and concerns. These 4 versions were picked due to their popularity, stability, and relevance to my mod as a whole.

[PlayerCommands_v1.0 Version Folder](https://github.com/Skellz64/Old-MC-PlayerCommands/tree/main/PlayerCommands_v1.0)

<code style="color : gray">the downloads are named "PlayerCommands_v1.0_" followed by "(version name)" ensure that you are downloading the correct version</code>

# How to install

Install [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html) , most mods for older versions use Java 8. So it's always a good idea to have it.

This is a jarmod so I recommend using MultiMC, PrismLauncher, or Betacraft v2.0. These launchers allow for jarmods to be easily setup older versions. They all have similar ways of adding jarmods... Edit your instance in said launcher, locate the <code style="color : gray">add to Minecraft.jar</code> button, and open the downloaded coords.zip.

For Betacraft v1.0, it's more complex as you will need to jarmod the version yourself. You will also need a zip explorer (I like WinRAR for Windows)

- after downloading coords.zip for prefered version, open the hidden <code style="color : gray">%appdata%</code> folder
- open the <code style="color : gray">.betacraft</code> folder
- open the <code style="color : gray">versions</code> folder
- highlight and right click on the version.jar you are using (ex: <code style="color : gray">a1.1.2_01.jar</code>)
- after right click, you can choose <code style="color : gray">Open with WinRAR</code>
- with the jar open, also open the downloaded coords.zip
- move the <code style="color : gray">.class</code> files from the coords.zip to the opened version.jar.
- Press <code style="color : gray">OK</code> , done! You successfully replaced game files with my modded game files!
- Relaunch Betacraft v1.0 and play
